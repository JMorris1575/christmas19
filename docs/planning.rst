Planning for the Christmas 2019 Website
=======================================

I'm not planning any changes to the programming of this year's website so, besides getting the SSL Certificate working
again, I should just have to update the database with this year's information.

The problem I'm currently having is that I can't remember how to do anything! It's been quite some time since I've
done anything with my websites and I've forgotten all of the details. Fortunately, I made an **Instructions** project
that I can refer to for a lot of it.

Here are my current ideas of what I will need to do:

* Get SSL working on the Christmas 2018 website
* Copy the current database information from the Christmas 2018 website
* Transfer that to my home computers for archiving purposes
* Create a Christmas2019 Database on my home computers (not necessarily with that name)
* Prepare the Database with this year's information
* Get the website working on the home computers
* Deploy the website to webfaction.com
* Get SSL working on the Christmas 2019 website

Simple, right? We'll see...

Revising the Plan
-----------------

After getting SSL working on the Christmas 2018 website (put a reference to ssl.rst here) things are beginning to come
back to me, but it's definitely **not** like riding a bike! I now think a better plan is to:

* Get SSL working on the Christmas 2018 website (already done)
* Get my copied version of Christmas 2019 to work on the local computer
* Update the information in the database and in of the html files where it is necessary
* Develop some new content for the activities: trivia questions, recipes, what is it? items.
* Deploy the revised website to webfaction

We'll see how that works.
